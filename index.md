### Fun Facts
- I have a twin sister.
- I'm Persian.
- I love salads--literally any type of salad.

### Career Goals
I have a great passion for social justice and creative writing, so I hope to pursue law and authorship. I'm thrilled to be publishing a young adult fantasy novel before I graduate high school. With all that being said, computer science has always interested me and I'd love to have some coding skills up my arsenal.
